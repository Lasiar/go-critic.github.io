## Trophies

Contributions are partitioned by projects.

By "contribution", we mean all of these:

1. Commit that fixes the problem
2. Reported issue (if there is no commit yet)
3. Any other form of advices that were suggested by `go-critic`

The list is sorted by priority.
If commit exist, it should be referenced instead of issue.
If issue exist, is should be referenced (as opposed of 3 where
we have no explicit issue ticket).
